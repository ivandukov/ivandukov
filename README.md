# Greetings!

![CodingShiba](shibapicture.png)

Hi, I'm Ivan — a backend-focused software engineer who enjoys dabbling in front-end work from time to time. I'm currently based in the Rhein-Main region in Germany, where I also studied computer science.

By day, I work on scalable, maintainable systems using modern back-end stacks and cloud infrastructure. By night (and sometimes lunch breaks), I'm either playing guitar, making music, or doing some fitness because, well, balance is important — especially in IT.

### My vibe
- Experienced full-stack engineer with a strong focus on backend development, microservices, and cloud-native architecture.
- I’ve built and optimized payment systems, designed resilient data pipelines, and delivered scalable features across various tech stacks.
- I'm a big fan of clean code, pragmatic solutions, and strong team communication.
- I take an **AI-first approach** to development — using LLMs and automation wherever they make things faster or cleaner.

### 🛠️ Languages & Tools I’ve Worked With
**Professionally (or significantly):**
`React`, `TypeScript`, `PHP 8 (typed + linted)`, `Symfony`, `Laravel (not a fan)`, `Chakra UI`, `Ubuntu`, `Java`, `GitLab CI/CD`, `PostgreSQL`, `MariaDB`, `ElasticSearch`, `Python`, `Pimcore`, `Kubernetes`, `MongoDB`, `Golang`, `IBM MQ`, `HP NonStop`, `Kafka`, `Jenkins`, `Clickhouse`, `Nginx`, `Terraform`, `AWS`, `C++` (regretfully), `ARM Assembly`, `Angular`,

### Currently Exploring / Interested In
- Golang, NestJS, Kotlin, C#, Java(hm) 
- AI tooling: autonomous agents, LLM workflows, prompt chaining, performance-focused AI integration
- Observability: metrics, tracing (OpenTelemetry)
- DevOps: Infrastructure as Code, advanced Kubernetes usage, progressive delivery strategies
- Frontend: modern React and design systems like Chakra UI
- Cloud system design: multi-cloud strategies, service meshes, distributed architecture patterns
- Management and leadership: technical decision-making, scaling dev teams, improving collaboration and delivery pipelines


### Not My Thing
- Laravel projects with magic, no types, or legacy PHP (< v8)
- Random, hype-based JavaScript frameworks
- C (unless someone convinces me it’s actually not that bad)
- Super advanced network configuration (I just never got good at it)
