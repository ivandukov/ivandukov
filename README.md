## Greetings!

My name is Ivan and I am mostly a back-end developer, who actually likes doing front-end some of the time. I am currently based in the Rhein-Main region in Germany, where I also studied. When I am not crafting top software(lmao), you can find me either playing guitar or creating music. Sometimes I also run and do fitness, but that's because the nature of the IT world I guess.

### Languages and Tools:

#### ðŸ¤” Stuff that I have done something with (mostly professionaly): 
React, Typescript, PHP8 (typed and linted), Symfony, Laravel(hate it),Chakra UI, Ubuntu, xUnit, Java(not spring/boot), Gitlab CI/CD (gitlab superior platform imo), C++ (not proud on this one), PostgreSQL, MariaDB, ElasticSearch, CSS (Less), Python, Pimcore, Kubernetes(little bit), MongoDB, Golang, IBM MQ, HP NonStop, ARM Assembly 

#### ðŸŒ± Topics/Stuff that I am interested in/want to learn more about:
- More of Golang, Rust, Kotlin, Typescript(C#)
- Microservice infrastructure (event driven with Apache Kafka)
- Observability (OpenTelemetry)
- Kubernetes
- Infrastructure as code and cool ways to deploy stuff
- AWS or the other two top cloud platforms

#### âš¡ Not interested in:
- Random Javascript frameworks
- PHP projects which have no types / use magic laravel shit / under version 8
- C (maybe it's not so bad as I remember)
- Server administration or network configuration
